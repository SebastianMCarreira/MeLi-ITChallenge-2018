This one was easy, it was very straightfoward and had a simple code. One just had to check for each possible letter, and see if it meets both conditions, to be present in every given string and to be repeated more than twice in every string, so, just meeting the second condition is enough. At first, I understood that it had to be repeated more than twice in at least one string, not in every string, making the first condition make some sense, but after trying 25 as the answer, (because there were 5 "special" letters if the conditions were to be present in every string and repeated more than twice in at least one) I decided to try and see if the condition was to be repeated more than twice in every string, it in fact was like that. Later I commented the function to check if a letter was present in every string because it was redundant to check that and it to be repeated too.
