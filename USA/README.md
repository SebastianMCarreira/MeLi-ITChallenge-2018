This one was a little bit hard to understand exactly what they were asking for. At first, I didn't understand how the string was supposed to be splitted and what was I supposed to compare to what. What they were asking exactly was to take the original string, make a new one keeping the substring from the Nth character to the end (for N from 0 to the length of the original string) and check how long is the shared preffix. After getting that number for each N, you add all together and you get the result for one string. Doing that for each given string and printing the result for each one in the given order with a space in between gives you the answer.
