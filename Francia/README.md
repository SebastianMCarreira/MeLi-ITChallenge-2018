This one was also easy, but this time, coding something made more sense as counting the a's, b's, c's and d's from a 4k long string would take a lot of time and most likely end up in a wrong count.

The only thing the program does is obtaining the amount of a's, b's, c's and d's in the string with the "count" method and then checks if both a+c and b+d are even.
